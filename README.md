## Acknowledgments

Read [Pregel: A System for Large-Scale Graph Processing](https://15799.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2013/static/papers/p135-malewicz.pdf)
for a reference on how to implement your own Graph processing algorithms in a Pregel fashion. If you want to take some 
inspiration from some curated-sources, just explore the [/examples](https://github.com/angelip2303/graph-rs/tree/main/examples)
folder of this repository.
